<h2>Motivation</h2>
Experiment with react-jsonschema-form


<h2>Installation</h2>

```
npm i
```

<h2>Usage</h2>

```
npm run dev
```

<h2>Use cases</h2>
At the moment i am not sure that @rjsf/core can be used in production UI where slick design is required. However, it can be used for sure e.g. as super quick implementation for admin setup pages.

<h2>open issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>I am getting warning when rendering MyForm1 'Warning: Using UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps in strict mode is not recommended and may indicate bugs in your code'</li>
</ul>
